Hello, @aegonSQL here!👋

I'm on a journey to mastering all things data & all the automation needed to get value from it. While on this mission, I'll try to document my journey here..
My professional experience may suggest I'm an SQL and Power BI expert already but if you asked me same, I'll say I just probably learnt something new today & will do tomorrow also 🔁😉
